# Link-Analysis-Project

This project addresses three key problems in network analysis:

1. **Identifying the Top Leader in an Impression Network**  
   Implemented a random walk algorithm to identify the most influential node (leader) within an impression network.

2. **Predicting Missing Links**  
   Developed a recommendation model to predict missing links in the network using matrix completion techniques.

3. **Analyzing Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)**  
   Derived relationships between strongly connected components in the impression network to better understand its structure.

## Project Structure

- `project_a.py`: Contains the implementation of the random walk algorithm to identify the top leader.
- `project_b.py`: Includes the code for predicting missing links using the matrix method.
- `project_c.py`: Analyzes and derives relationships between strongly connected components in the network.
- `explanation.pdf`: Detailed explanation of the methods, algorithms, and results for each of the above problems.

## How to Run

1. **Random Walk Algorithm (Top Leader Identification)**  
   ```bash
   python project_a.py

2. **Missing Link Prediction**  
   ```bash
   python project_b.py

3. **SCC Analysis**  
   ```bash
   python project_c.py

Each script can be run independently to solve the corresponding problem. The explanation of the methods and results can be found in the project_details.pdf file.
